# IPL-1st-inning-score-predition

This project is based on data recorded in the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches in the years 2008- to 2017. The objective was to develop a predictive model that predicts the total score of the team batting first, based on the current state of the match (during 5th to 20th over).  
The Linear regression, ridge, lasso, and elastic net models were fitted, and further to reduce test RMSE, random forest and neural network models were fitted. Among these models, Random Forest Model gave the lowest Test RMSE (8.590519) and lowest test MAPE (3.653%). Therefore, This model was selected as the best model and was used to develop the data product application to get the predictions of 1st inning score.
